## Project Description
Word scavenger hunt is a fun way to learn! There are infinite possibilities a player can come to as an input... so we decided to embrace the challenge and develop a code that could analyze each possible combination of letters in Spanish.

<a name="workflow"></a>

## Workflow
1. Build from scratch a pseudocode to outline the idea.
2. Gather information from different resources to understand the tools that apply to this project's needs.
3. Import the libraries prior the coding process. 
4. Start with a try & error stage. 
5. Debug the code before attempting to simplify it.
6. Make a legible layout (documentation included) by merging all the functions into a master function. 
7. Run a second try & error stage.
8. Identify areas of improvement by picturing the possible user inputs.
9. Execute a Final Diagnosis. 
10. Start Playing!

## Organization
Zoom was our best friend for communication in times of COVID-19.
Google Collab helped us creating the first drafts of the code. 
Jupyter Notebook became our hero when Collab turned out to be an unstable environment for our code.
Powerpoint as always was a powerful tool to present our ideas.
Google Search was the third element of the team without dissapointing us.
